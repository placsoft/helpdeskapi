# What is HelpDesk ? 

A help desk is the individual, group, organizational function or external service that an IT user calls to get help with a problem. A help desk can be as simple as a physical desk where a support person takes calls. It also can be a global organization that accepts support requests submitted online or in person from around the world. The help desk function is often outsourced to support specialists.

# What is a Ticket tracking sytem 

A growing customer base is a sign of a growing business. But guess what happens when you have more and more customers?  Countless support issues, hundreds of request emails, and phones ringing non-stop in your customer service department. In the business world, customer problems are inevitable. There will always be customers who need your assistance while making a big purchase, or simply for resetting their account password. To rise above these challenges and stay ahead of the curve, a ticket management system can prove to be a real game-changer for your team. You can handle your current ticket load, scale your operations with ease, and monitor your progress at every step of the way.
